## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Learning Outcomes

With my limited experience in Frontend development, I recreated a section of NodeFlair's job-listing [webpage](https://nodeflair.com/jobs?query=&page=1&sort_by=relevant) in under 48hours. While some may complete it under a day, or even a few hours, I am still satisfied with my accomplishment and the results.

Having little to no experience, I do welcome any feedback on how my project can be improved in terms of:

1. Functionality (e.g. Responsiveness, Aesthetic)
2. Cleanliness (e.g. Code Structure, Reusability, Extensibility)

## Efforts

Features Recreated:

- [x] Job-listing Cards (Logo, Organization, Technical Role, Job Title, Tech Stack, Location, Estimated Pay...)
- [x] Job-listing Card Hover
- [x] Job-listing Select Display Right-panel
- [x] "Sticky" Right-panel
- [x] Responsive Design (Desktop/Laptop vs Phone)

Features Lacking/Limitations:

- [ ] Selected Job-listing Border
- [ ] Tech Stack Cut-off

## Tech Stack

NodeFlair-Clone was built with React, Next.js, Tailwind.css and hosted with Vercel.

## Credits

Credits to NodeFlair for allowing me to replicate their website as part of their technical assessment. All logos belong to their respective organizations.
